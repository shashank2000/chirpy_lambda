      {get_ack()} Surprisingly, in 2017, astronomers detected an unusual object passing by our planet. It was unlike 
      anything we have ever seen. It was a long and thin asteroid, like a cigar, tumbling end over end through space, 
      accelerating as if something was pushing on it. Scientists couldn't figure out why it was moving the way 
      it was and called it 'Oumuamua, which is Hawaiian for: 'a messenger from afar arriving first'.  
      Some think it was a probe sent by an alien civilization. Rather mysterious, don't you think?
