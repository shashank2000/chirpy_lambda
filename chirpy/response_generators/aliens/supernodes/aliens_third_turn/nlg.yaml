      {get_ack()} Some say that if there was intelligent life out there, 
      then we should have already found evidence of it by now, especially with our space explorations 
      and powerful telescopes searching every day for signs of alien life. 
      But maybe this paradox can be explained by the Great Filter, 
      which hypothesizes that there exists a barrier preventing civilizations developing further and traversing the galaxy. 
      For example, a civilization might run out of resources or encounter a planet-destroying asteroid. Isn't that intriguing?
