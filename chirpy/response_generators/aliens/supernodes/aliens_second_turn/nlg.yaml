      Exactly! There are so many strange and fantastic planets scattered across the Milky Way Galaxy, over a hundred billion 
      actually! Some of them are located at just the right distance from a star to support life. 
      Perhaps there is life there, but why haven’t we heard anything from them? Can it really be that we are so 
      alone in the universe?
